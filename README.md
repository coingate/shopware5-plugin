Please note, that for "Test" mode you **must** generate separate API credentials on <https://sandbox.coingate.com>. API credentials generated on <https://coingate.com> will **not** work for "Test" mode.

Also note, that *Receive Currency* parameter in your module configuration window defines the currency of your settlements from CoinGate. Set it to BTC, EUR or USD, depending on how you wish to receive payouts.
